# Abstract

Wireless packet captures save *all* the data that gets transferred over a WLAN. As a result, running a packet capture over a prolonged period of time takes up a ton of disk space. If you just want to record some specific information about network use (such as usage peaks, data rates, etc.), then you want something much more lightweight.

This project provides a simple way to collect usage information about a wireless network. It is much cheaper than a packet capture, since it only saves select information about the packets transferred over the network.
